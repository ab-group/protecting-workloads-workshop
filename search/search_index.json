Build Assess Remediate Verify","title":"Workshop Phases"},{"location":"inspector-sm/assess/","text":"Protecting Your Workloads - Assess Phase In the previous Build Phase, you deployed a CloudFormation stack that contains some Amazon EC2 instances behind an application load balancer. You are now going to use Amazon Inspector to assess the instances and identify findings that need to be remediated. Before you can assess the instances with Amazon Inspector, you need to identify the instances and install the Amazon Inspector agent on them. This is easier to do in small environments with only a few instances but can become more difficult in organizations with hundreds or even thousands of instances. For this reason, you are going to learn how to use tags to select the instances on which you will install the Amazon Inspector agent. Tags are labels that can be attached to AWS resources to make it easier to act on them collectively. In this section you will do the following tasks: Examine the CloudFormation stack you built to learn about the tags that were applied by AWS CloudFormation. Use AWS Systems Manager to install the Amazon Inspector agent on the instances and run the scan Learn about Amazon Inspector rules packages Examine Amazon Inspector findings Examine the stack that you built and its tags Go to the CloudFormation console in the same AWS region in which you created the stack in the Build Phase. You should see a list of stacks similar to the figure below. Locate the stack you created. In this documentation, the name of the stack is pww . Copy this stack name into a scratch file on your workstation in case you need it later. Click the check box to the left of the stack name and then click the Resources tab below. You will see a list of resources that were deployed by the stack as shown in the figure below. The Type column lists the type of the resouces. Notice that you will not see any resources of type AWS::EC2::Instance. The reason for this is that the CloudFormation stack did not deploy any. The stack did, however, deploy an auto scaling group with a launch configuration that in turn launched the instances. The auto scaling group itself has tags and was configured to propogate the same tags (attributes) to the instances it launches. In a production environment, you may have a large number of resources that spin up and spin down because of the elastiicity that AWS offers. Knowing that the tags will be the same can make it easier for you to manage the environment regardless of how many instances exist at any point in time. You will now learn how to look up the Amazon EC2 instances using tags. Go to the Amazon EC2 console and look for instances having a name that begins with the stack name followed by -node , pww-node in this example. If you cannot see them, type the instance name ( pww-node in this case) into the search box. Select one of them by checking the box to the left of the instance and then click on the Tags tab. You should see a table like that in the figure below. Notice that the instance has tags reflecting the CloudFormation stack name and stack id. These tags are added because of settings in the auto scaling group which propogate tags to newly created instances. You have now learned about the tags that you can use to look up AWS resources. You will take advantage of this feature when you set up Amazon Inspector later in this phase. Install the Inspector Agent on the Amazon EC2 instances Now that you know how to identify the instances in the environment, you need to install the Amazon Inspector agent on them. AWS Systems Manager provides a way for you to run commands across your Amazon EC2 instances. The commands are defined in documents . AWS provides a document that you will use to install the Amazon Inspector agent. You will use tags to identify the instances on which to apply the document. Go to the AWS Systems Manager console. Under the Actions menu on the left, click Run Command . You will be taken to the AWS Systems Manager Run Command home screen. Click the Run a Command button and the Run a Command screen will appear. In the Command document window, page through the available documents until you find the document named AmazonInspector-ManageAWSAgent . Click the radio button to the left of that document as shown in the figure below. Scroll further down until you can see the Targets window. Click the Specifying a tag radio button. For the tag key, enter aws:cloudformation:stack-name . For the value enter the name of the CloudFormation stack you created ( pww in this example) and click Add . Your screen should be similar to the figure below. Scroll down to the Output options window. Clear the box next to Enable writing to an S3 bucket as shown in the figure below. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the Run button. You will then be be taken to the command status window while the installation of the Amazon Inspector is running. You can periodically update the command status by clicking on the refresh button within the window. After the commands finish running, the Overall status should be Success as shown in the figure below. The number of instances may vary based on the version of the template. You have now installed the Amazon Inspector agent on the instances in the environment. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the instances Configure the Amazon Inspector target Go to the Amazon Inspector console and click Get Started if prompted. If you see a \"Welcome to Amazon Inspector\" wizard appear, click Cancel . You will set up Amazon Inspector manually so you can become more familiar with the service. Click Assessment Targets on the left menu and then click the Create button. Scroll down to the Assessment Target window. In the Name field, enter a name for the target. For example, given that the stack name in this example is pww , you can enter pww targets or another name of your choosing. In the Use Tags section, select aws:cloudformation:stack-name for the key from the drop down list and select the name of the stack ( pww in this example) from the drop down value list. Uncheck the Install Agents check box since we have already installed the agent. Your screen should look similar to the figure below. Click the Save button to save the target definition. Inspector may prompt you for permission to create a service linked role to give the Amazon Inspector service permission to retrieve information about your instances. If you see a prompt like the one in the figure below, click Ok to create the role. You have now created an Amazon Inspector target that identifies the instances that would be assessed. The target selects instances based on tag values. In this case, the tag you are using is aws:cloudformation:stack-name which is set to the name of the CloudFormation stack. In particular, the tag is added to the auto scaling launch configuration which is configured to propogate the tag to the Amazon EC2 instances that it launches. Because of this, Amazon Inspector will automatically scan new instances that may appear over the lifetime of the environment. This is an example of how the elasticity of the AWS cloud when combined with tagging can enable you to support dynamic environments. Configure the Amazon Inspector template and run the assessment Now that you have created an Amazon Inspector target, you will now create an Amazon Inspector tepmlate. You use templates to define the Amazon Inspector targets and rule packages that comprise an assessment run. Go to the Amazon Inspector console, click Assessment templates on the menu, and then click Create . In the Name field, enter a name for the template. In the Target name field, select the target you previously created from the list of options. In the Rules packages field, select Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures and Security Best Practices . In the Duration field, select 15 minutes . Do not accept the default value! In the Assessment Schedule, uncheck (turn off) the Set up recurring assessment runs so that the assessment template will only run a one-time assessment. Scroll to the bottom and click the Create and run button to save the template and run the assessment. Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to scroll down multiple windows. If you cannot click Create and run , make sure you unchecked the box in the previous step and try again. The assessment will start and will take 15 minutes to compete. On the Amazon Inspector menu, click Assessment rus . You should see an entry for the assesment you just started. While the assessment is running, the status will be Collecting data . Periodically refresh the screen to see the current status. When the assessment run ends, the status will change to Analysis complete. The assessment will run for approximately 15 minutes. While you are waiting, continue with the steps below. Learn more about Amazon Inspector Rules Packages Amazon Inspector offers a variety of rules packages that can be included in assessments. The applicable rules packages may vary by operating system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assessment is based on the CVE project that is hosted at cve.mitrei.org . Open a new tab in your browser to cve.mitre.orf . Click on Search CVE List . Enter CVE-2018-20169 into the search field and click Submit . This shows you how to research known vulnerabilities. The Security Best Practices rule package examines some common configuration settings for some of the most commobn Amazon Linux settings. You can read more about this rule package here . Examine the findings After the assessment run has completed, go to the Amazon Inspector console and click Assessment runs . The window should be similar to what appears below. On the line that represents your most recent run, make note of the number in the Findings column (22 in this diagram). After you perform the remediation later in this workshop, that number should decrease. Click on the number in the Findings column. The findings associated with the run will appear as shown below. You will see findings for each of the rules packages that you used in the assessment. The number of findings often varies by the age of the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) because older AMIs typically have more vulnerabilities than newer AMIs. Choose one of the findings associated with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures rule package. An example appears below. Note that there is a link in the recommendation on which you can click to see the CVE entry. Now that you have run the assessment and seen the findings you are ready to perform some remediation.

Choose one of the findings associated with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures rule package. An example appears below.

You are now going to assess the posture of the site and then add an AWS WAF Web ACL to your site. In this section you will do the following tasks: Identify the stack you built Look up the output values for your environment and test access Use your Red Team Host to test for website vulnerabilities Identify the stack that you built Go to the CloudFormation console in the same AWS region in which you created the stack in the Build Phase. You should see a list of stacks similar to the figure below. Locate the stack you created. In this documentation, the name of the stack is pww . Copy this stack name into a scratch file on your workstation in case you need it later. Look up the Stack Outputs Go to the stack outputs and look for the website URL stored in the albEndpoint output value. Test access to the site by right clicking and opening in a new tab. Note the URL for your site as this will be used throughout this workshoop module. While in the stack outputs, note the ScannerUID value. This Id value will be used to identify the posture of your site within the automated scanner and the associated dashboard. While still in stack outputs, right click the link in RedTeamHostSession and open in new tab. This will launch an AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to the host you will use to perform add hock scans against your site URL. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. Website Scanning Environment and Tools In order to test your AWS WAF ruleset, this lab has been configured with two scanning capabilities; a Red Team Host where you can invoke manual scanning and an automated scanner which runs from outside your lab environment. The scanner performs 10 basic tests designed to help simulate and mitigate common web attack vectors. Canary GET - Should not be blocked Canary POST - Should not be blocked SQL Injection (SQLi) in Query String SQL Injection (SQLi) in Cookie Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Query String Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Body Inclusion in Modules Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Missing Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Invalid Path Traversal Note about Tests These basic tests are designed to provide common examples you can use to test AWS WAF functionality. You should perform thorough analysis and testing when implementing rules into your production environments. Website Scanning Environment and Tools - Manual Scanning Once you have started a Session Manager connection to your Red Team Host, the scanner script can be invoked by typing the following command while in the /usr/bin directory: python3 scanner.py http://your-alb-endpoint The scanner.py script will run each of the tests above and report back the following information: Request : The HTTP request command used. Test Name : The name of the test from list above. Result : The HTTP status code returned. As you can see by running the script there are several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. In the remnediate phase you will configure an AWS WAF Web ACL to block these requests. When AWS WAF blocks a web request based on the conditions that you specify, it returns HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden). For a full view of the request and response information, you can paste the Request command directly into the console and add the --debug argument. Note about Testing Tool The scanner.py script uses an open source HTTP client called httpie . HTTPie\u2014aitch-tee-tee-pie\u2014is a command line HTTP client with an intuitive UI, JSON support, syntax highlighting, wget-like downloads, plugins, and more. Website Scanning Environment and Tools - Automated Scanning For an AWS sponsored event, in addition to the ad hock scanning, automated scanning is also performed against your lab website. The automated tests are similar to the manual tests but the results are posted to a centralized scanning results dashboard along with the other workshop particpants. You can identify the scanning results for your site using the Unique Id found in the CloudFormation outputs.

You should see 2 entries into the associated IP address list for the loopback/localhost IP addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128). AWS WAF rule design and considerations Basics Writing rules for AWS WAF involves the creation of conditions. Conditions are lists of specific filters (patterns) that are being matched against the HTTP request components processed by AWS WAF. The filters, including their attributes, are specific to the type of condition supported by AWS WAF. A condition, as a whole, is considered as matched, if any one of the listed filters is matched. Conditions are independent and reusable resources within the regional scope where they are created. Rules contain one or more conditions. Each condition attached to a rule is called a predicate. Predicates are evaluated using Boolean logic. A predicate is evaluated as matched or not matched (negated predicted), and multiple predicates are evaluated using Boolean AND \u2013 all predicates must match for the rule action to be triggered. Rules are also independent and reusable resources within the regional scope where they are created. Web ACLs are ordered lists of rules. They are evaluated in order for each HTTP request and the action of the first matching rule is taken by the WAF engine, whether that is to allow, block or count the request. If no rule matches, the default action of the web ACL prevails. Multiple web ACLs can reuse the same rules, and multiple rules can reuse the same conditions assuming that is desirable from a change management process point of view for your workloads. This creates effectively a dependency tree between these AWS WAF components. Rule Design To create a rule, you have to create the relevant match conditions first. This process requires planning for effective rule building. Use the following guiding questions: What is the intended purpose of the rule? What HTTP request components apply to the purpose of the rule? Do you already have conditions targeting those request components that you can reuse? Is that desirable? How can you define the purpose of the rule in a Boolean logic expression? What conditions do you need to create to implement the logic? Are any transformations relevant to my input content type? For example, we want to build a rule to detect and block SQL Injection in received form input requests. Let\u2019s see how these questions help us plan the implementation of the rule: Rule purpose: Detect SQL Injection in form input HTTP requests, use \u2018block\u2019 action in Web ACL HTTP request components: Request Method \u2013 form input typically gets submitted using a POST HTTP request method Request Body \u2013 form input is typically encoded in the body of the HTTP request Define the purpose of the rule using Boolean logic: If Request Method = POST and Request Body contains suspected SQL Injection then block Conditions to implement: String Match Condition targeting the request METHOD field, expecting the exact value POST SQL Injection Match Condition targeting the request BODY field Relevant transformations: SQL Injection Match Condition form input is sometimes HTML encoded, so it\u2019s a good idea to apply the HTML_ENTITY_DECODE transformation. Other transformations might also apply, such as URL_DECODE Rules to implement: Rule with 2 predicates matching both the string matching condition and SQL injection condition Console Walkthrough - Creating a Condition and Rule In the AWS WAF console, create a string match condition by selecting String and regex matching from the side-bar menu to the left of the console, under the Conditions heading. Click on Create Condition : 3. Provide the name and region. Set the type to String match . 4. Add a filter (pattern) to the condition. Set the Part of the request to filter on to HTTP method , the match type to Exactly matches , the transformation to None and the value to match as POST . Click Add filter . 5. You can add multiple filters to the string match condition. Once you are confident the list is complete, click Create at the bottom of the screen. 6. With the condition created, and any additional conditions created based on need as well, you are ready to create a rule. In the AWS WAF console, select Rules from the side-bar menu to the left of the console, under the AWS WAF heading. 7. Click on Create Rule : 8. Provide the name, metric name and region. Set the rule type to Regular rule . 9. Add a condition to the rule. For our rule example, choose \u201cWhen a request\u201d does (no negation) match at least one of the filters in the string match condition . Choose the string match condition you have previously created. 10. Click Add Condition and repeat step 9 for any additional conditions you wish to add. 11. Click Create at the bottom of the screen when you have added all relevant conditions. 12. Follow the steps in the \u201cIdentify the WAF ACL for your site\u201d section above to go back to the Rules tab of your web ACL. 13. Click Edit web ACL . 14. In the Rules dropdown, select your rule, and click Add rule to web ACL . 15. Reorder the rules as appropriate for your use case. 16. Click Update to persist the changes. Mitigating Common Vulnerabilities & Monitoring for Attacks For a more comprehensive discussion of common vulnerabilities for web applications, as well as how to mitigate them using AWS WAF, and other AWS services, please refer to the Use AWS WAF to Mitigate OWASP\u2019s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities whitepaper . In this phase, we will have a set of 6 exercises walking you through the process of building a basic mitigation rule set for common vulnerabilities. We will build these rules from scratch, so you can gain familiarity with the AWS WAF programming model and you can then write rules specific to your applications. Note About Excersise Solutions We encourage you to attempt to create the rules on your own but have included the solutions as a backup in case you get stuck. You can test your ACL ruleset at any time using the Red Team Host. For AWS sponsored event, you can also view test results on the WAF Lab Dashboard . 1. SQL Injection & Cross Site Scripting Mitigation Use the SQL injection, cross-site scripting, as well as string and regex matching conditions to build rules that mitigate injection attacks and cross site scripting attacks. Consider the following: - How does your web application accept end-user input (whether directly or indirectly). Which HTTP request components does that input get inserted into? - What kind of content encoding considerations do you need to factor in for the input format? - What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives? For example, does your application legitimately need to accept SQL statements as input? How do the requirements derived from the above questions affect your solution? Solution create SQLi condition named filterSQLi query_string, url decode body, html entity decode header, cookie, url decode 2. Limit Attack Footprint Use the string and regex matching conditions along with geo match and IP address match conditions to build rules that limit the attack footprint against the exposed components of your application. Consider the following: \u2022 Does your web application have server-side include components in the public web path? \u2022 Does your web application have components at exposed paths that are not used (or dependencies have such functions)? \u2022 Do you have administrative, management, status or health check paths and components that aren\u2019t meant for end user access? You should consider blocking access to such elements, or limiting access to known sources, either whitelisted IP addresses or geographic locations. Solution create XSS condition named filterXSS query_string, url decode body, html entity decode body, url decode header, cookie, url decode 3. Enforce Request Hygiene Use the string and regex matching, size constraints and IP address match conditions to build rules that block non-conforming or low value HTTP requests. Consider the following: \u2022 Are there limits to the size of the various HTTP request components relevant to your web application? For example, does your application ever use URIs that are longer than 100 characters in size? \u2022 Are there specific HTTP request components without which your application cannot operate effectively (e.g. CSRF token header, authorization header, referrer header)? Build rules that ensure the requests your application ends up processing are valid, conforming and valuable. Solution create string match condition named filterFormProcessor uri, starts with, no transform, \u201c/form.php\u201d create string match condition named filterPOSTMethod uri, exactly matches, no transform, \u201c/form.php\u201d create regex match condition named filterCSRFToken header x-csrf-token, matches pattern: ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ create rule named matchCSRF type regular does match string condition: filterFormProcessor does match string condition: filterPOSTMethod does not match regex match condition: filterCSRFToken add rules to Web ACL 4. Mitigate File Inclusion & Path Traversal Use the string and regex matching conditions to build rules that block specific patterns indicative of unwanted path traversal or file inclusion. Consider the following: Can end users browse the directory structure of your web folders? Do you have directory indexes enabled? Is your application (or any dependency components) use input parameters in filesystem or remote URL references? Do you adequately lock down access so input paths cannot be manipulated? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives (directory traversal signature patterns)? Build rules that ensure the relevant HTTP request components used for input into paths do not contain known path traversal patterns. Solution create string match condition named filterTraversal uri, starts with, url_decode, /include query_string, contains, url_decode, \u201c../\u201c query_string, contains, url_decode, \u201c://\u201c create rule named matchTraversal type regular does match string condition: filterTraversal add rules to Web ACL 5. Detect & Mitigate Anomalies What constitutes an anomaly in regards to your web application? A few common anomaly patterns are: Unusually elevated volume of requests in general Unusually elevated volumes of requests to specific URI paths Unusually elevated levels of requests generating specific non-HTTP status 200 responses Unusually elevated volumes from certain sources (IPs, geographies) Usual request signatures (referrers, user agent strings, content types, etc) Do you have mechanisms in place to detect such patterns? If so, can you build rules to mitigate them? Solution create string match condition named filterLoginProcessor uri, starts with, no transform, \u201c/login.php\u201d create rule named matchRateLogin type rate-based, 2000 does match string condition: filterLoginProcessor does match string condition: filterPOSTMethod add rules to Web ACL 6. Reputation Lists, Nuisance Requests (Optional) Reputation lists (whitelists or blacklists) are a good way to filter and stop servicing low value requests. This can reduce operating costs, and reduce exposure to attack vectors. Reputation lists can be self-maintained: lists of identifiable actors that you have determined are undesired. They can be identified any number of ways: the source IP address the user agent string reuse of hijacked authorization or session tokens, attempting to make requests to paths that clearly do not exist in your application but are well known vulnerable software packages (probing) Build blacklists of such actors using the relevant conditions and set up rules to match and block them. An example IP-based blacklist already exists in your sandbox environment. Reputation lists can also be maintained by third parties. The AWS WAF Security Automations allow you to implement IP-based reputation lists.

This can reduce operating costs, and reduce exposure to attack vectors. Reputation lists can be self-maintained: lists of identifiable actors that you have determined are undesired. They can be identified any number of ways: the source IP address the user agent string reuse of hijacked authorization or session tokens, attempting to make requests to paths that clearly do not exist in your application but are well known vulnerable software packages (probing) Build blacklists of such actors using the relevant conditions and set up rules to match and block them. An example IP-based blacklist already exists in your sandbox environment. Reputation lists can also be maintained by third parties. The AWS WAF Security Automations allow you to implement IP-based reputation lists. Click here to proceed to the Verify Phase.","title":"6.

The following AWS article details this process: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards-create-use-customized-metrics-views/ Here are some sample of metrics that you can use. Starting from top left side, in clockwise order, we have: Allowed vs Blocked Requests : if you receive a surge in allowed access (2 times normal peak access) or blocked access (any period that identifies more than 1,000 blocked requests), you can configure CloudWatch to send an alert. The idea here is to track known DDoS (when blocked requests increase) or new version of attack (when the requests are allowed to access the system); BytesDownloaded vs. Uploaded : help you identify when DDoS attack targets a service that doesn't need to receive a huge amount of access in order to exhaust resources (ex: search engine component sending MBs of information for one specific request parameters set); ELB Spillover and Queue length : use these metrics to verify if the attack is already causing damage to the infrastructure and/or for some reason, the attacker is bypassing protection layer and attacking directly unprotected resources; ELB Request Count : same as above, helps you identify damage by checking if the attacker is bypassing protection layer and/or CloudFront cache; review rules to increase cache hit rate; ELB Healthy Host : another system health check metric; ASG CPU Utilization : identify if the attacker is not only bypassing the CloudFront/WAF but also the ELB layer, also use to identify the damage impact of an attack; Click here to proceed to the next workshop module.","title":"Verify Phase"},{"location":"waf/verify/#mitigating-common-web-application-attack-vectors-using-aws-waf-verify-phase","text":"In the previous remediation phase, you implemented an AWS WAF ruleset to protect your site from common attack vectors.
